# Clear Habits

A task manager where tasks can be broken down into subtasks and time can be recorded against each entry. Keyboard driven where possible, and with a minimal UI.

## Motivation

When starting this project, I'd familiarised myself with Vue and wanted more from the To Do apps I was used to changing out on a regular basis. ClearHabits acted as a good test bed and I ultimately used it as my daily tasks app for 4+ years.

## Tech Stack

### Version 2

Version 2 was a complete rewrite of the client, upgrading from Vue 2 to Vue 3, and making use of the Nuxt framework and the UI Thing frontend UI framework.

Version 1 used the Quasar UI framework and the backend server was powered using Postgraphile.
